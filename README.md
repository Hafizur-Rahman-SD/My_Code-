Welcome to the repository for my C Programming Basics code! This collection serves as a beginner-friendly resource for those diving into the world of C programming. Whether you're new to coding or looking to refresh your skills, you'll find a variety of simple and well-commented programs here that cover fundamental concepts. Each code snippet is designed to illustrate key aspects of C programming, including variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. Feel free to explore and experiment with the code, modify it to suit your needs, and use it as a learning tool. I've organized the repository with clarity in mind, making it easy for you to navigate and understand the purpose of each program. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out. 

Happy coding!
